# Linux

Linux was first released in September 17, 1991 by Linus Torvalds. Linux itself is just the kernel in the GNU/Linux operating system. Linux is the most installed OS in the world, due to the fact that android use Linux as its OS. It is leading in many markets except for the desktop-market.

From a infosec perspective there are two reasons Linux is important. The first is that the majority of all servers in the world are operated by Linux. Therefore, if we want to hack those servers an understanding of the OS is highly recommended. The second reason is that the vast majority of all hacking-tools are only available on Linux.

This chapter focuses on some basic commands and basics of Linux. For Linux exist hundreds and thousands of books, for detailed information we refer to them.

Although there is only one Linux Kernel there are many Linux Distributions, meaning different versions because the GNU/Linux OS is a mix of GNU software and the Linux Kernel. The GNU/Linux OS can be packaged in thousand different ways, with different software preinstalled, different configurations, different Graphical User Interface \(GUI\). The fact that you can configure the OS as you want, has given rise to the many different versions. These different versions are usually called **distribution**. There are hundreds of different distributions. Famous ones are: Ubuntu, Debian, Redhat, CentOS and Arch.

Main differences between distributions:

* Package management program.
* Speed and interval of release
* Desktop environment
* Default GUI
* Community
* Compilation of the Linux Kernel

Every distribution fits other needs, some offer more stability and support while others have brand new tools and may are not stable and could run in problems more often.
